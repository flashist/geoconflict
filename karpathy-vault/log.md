- Issues flagged for human review: 5
- Most significant: 5 forward-reference broken links to pages not yet created (game-loop, networking, execution-pipeline, rendering, flashist-init) — resolve by running `/wiki-ingest architecture`

## 2026-04-15 — lint
- Issues found: 7
- Issues fixed: 6 (sprint-4 stale 8d-A note; back-links: cancelled-tasks→product-strategy, telemetry→sprint-3, server-performance→sprint-3, tutorial→sprint-1/sprint-2/hotfix-post-sprint2)
- Issues flagged for human review: 1
- Most significant: FeedbackModal.ts:265 already implements the sprint-3 "Feedback — match IDs" task — verify whether it's truly complete before treating as pending

## 2026-04-15 — lint
- Issues found: 20
- Issues fixed: 20
- Issues flagged for human review: 0
- Most significant: `features/ai-players` incorrectly marked as "planned" — `PlayerType.AiPlayer` is confirmed active in production across 10+ files; also fixed sprint attribution errors (reconnection and feedback-button were Sprint 1, not Sprint 2) and 15 missing bidirectional back-links across analytics, game-overview, sprint pages, and autospawn/stale-build decision pages

- Skipped (already covered): 53 remaining eligible `ai-agents/knowledge-base/*.md`, `ai-agents/sprints/done/*.md`, and `ai-agents/tasks/done/*.md` files were already represented by existing wiki pages; this sync only refreshed the stale decision pages and added the missing Sprint 6 page

## 2026-04-17 — lint
- Issues found: 29
- Issues fixed: 24
- Issues flagged for human review: 5
- Most significant: fixed template drift on feature/task pages, corrected stale HF-11 status and trigger details against current code, and closed all bidirectional cross-link gaps; remaining warnings are the five still-missing architecture/system pages (`flashist-init`, `game-loop`, `networking`, `execution-pipeline`, `rendering`)
